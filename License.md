**Article 2 : Licenses**

There are two types of Software licenses available to the Licensee, a Non-Commercial license and a Commercial license. The Licensee may only choose one of these two licenses. The license is valid for the version of the software available when this SLA is established. In order to use a new major version of the software that provides substantially added functionality, the Licensee must obtain a new license. A Non-Commercial license may be transferred to a Commercial license any time by fulfilling the obligations stated in Article 1.2 and Article 2.2. A Commercial license may never be transferred to a Non-Commercial license.

**Article 2.1 : Non-Commercial License**

The Licensee is eligible to install and to use this Software by 1 person and on any number of computers. In case there are more than one potential users of the Software, each user must obtain a separate license.

**Article 2.2 : Commercial License**

The Licensee is eligible to install and to use this Software by 1 person and on a maximum of 2 computers.

In case of payment is required for the fulfillment of the commercial license, the payment must be done by bank transfer. The Commercial License is only valid after this payment is fulfilled.

This non-reimbursement applies even if the SLA is terminated by ZSO or by the Licensee.

The Software is delivered by e-mail or by automatic download.
