## Introduction

AI-TOOLKIT is an **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Software Toolkit** for easy training, testing and prediction of machine learning models and for creating machine learning flow (several AI models working seamlessly together). **No programming skills are needed at all for building and using state of the art machine learning models!** Easy to use and contains several types of machine learning models which can be used separately or connected to each other (ML Flow). There is also a built-in very fast SQL database in order to make the storage of your machine learning data compact and easy. The database supports several GB's of data storage and several databases can be used even in one project.

Currently the following machine learning models are supported:

*	Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification and Regression.
*	Random Forest Classification.
*	Feedforward Neural Network for Classification and Regression (with many layer types available).
*	Convolutional Feedforward Neural Network for Classification.

You can use the built-in machine learning models separately (training and prediction/inference) or you can build a larger **AI system in which several AI models are working together in a flow**. Working together in a flow means that one machine learning model may use the output of one or more other machine learning models in a continuous running AI system.

There are several **easy to apply machine learning model templates** built-in which makes building a complex AI model very easy by using just some mouse clicks. You can train and test your models easily.

You can import any delimited text data file into the database. You can also import images which will be converted automatically to machine learning data and saved into the database.

There is an **easy to use database** editor which can be used to view and edit all AI-TOOLKIT databases. The database editor and the AI-TOOLKIT both support encrypted databases in case you need to secure your data.

All machine learning models are **optimized for maximum performance and accuracy**.
